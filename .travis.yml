# vim ft=yaml
#
# travis-ci.org definition for PyHRF build (based on PyMVPA, based on
# nipype configuration which in turn was based on nipy)
#
# We pretend to be erlang because we need can't use the python support in
# travis-ci; it uses virtualenvs, they do not have numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
# and it is impractical to build them.  We do not use anaconda to get closer
# to real Debian-based deployments and test against releases present in Debian
# and NeuroDebian

# vim ft=yaml
# Multiple lines can be made a single "virtual line" because of the way that
# Travis munges each line before executing it to print out the exit status.
# It's okay for it to be on multiple physical lines, so long as you remember:
# - There can't be any leading "-"s - All newlines will be removed, so use
# ";"s
